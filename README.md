## Installation

Clone the GitHub repo. Run `npm i` to install required packages and dependencies. Initialize the database, using your own MySQL credentials in the .env.EXAMPLE file provided. Seed the database if required, or create a User profile and start blogging from scratch!

## Usage

When first accessed, the homepage displays the most recent blog posts with a navigation bar with options for 'Home', 'Dashboard', 'Login' and 'Sign-Up'. Users cannot view single blogs, write comments or publish blog posts until they have logged in or created a User profile.

## Improvements

I did not manage to get as far as I would have liked with this homework asssignment, especially such a large one. I did start working on it early, but got very stuck with a MySQL issue and had my tutor session rescheduled to the next day which meant I was unable to make any progress with the project until this has been fixed, as I would have been coding blind and unable to test what I was doing. This really set me back so although I have writted a lot of the required files, there is not a lot of actual functionality to the site, which I am disappointed with. I have not yet build up the comments function of the site. I plan to work on this for another couple of days and resubmit with much more of the assignment criteria being met.
